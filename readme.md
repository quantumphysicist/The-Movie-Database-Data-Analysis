# Data Analysis: The Movie Database

In the report (`project-investigate-a-dataset.ipynb`), we analyse a dataset obtained from The Movie Database (TMDB). The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies; this information includes numerical data such as budget, revenue, and user ratings, as well as non-numerical data such as director, cast, and genre.

We investigate the most popular directors, production companies, and genres. We also investigate which properties are associated with movies revenue.
